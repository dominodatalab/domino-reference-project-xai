Model interpretability will be one of the seminal topics of data science over the next decade. 
The field is moving quickly. Practitioners can leverage a range of tools to provide 
explainability to their models from principles of traditional statistical modeling to the latests in deep neural 
network explainers.

This project contains starter code for a few of these approaches.

## Getting Started:

### 1. You do not have to be logged in to browse and download files from the left navigation bar.

In particular look at ***SHAP_and_LIME.ipynb*** and ***rtemis.R***. My xAI presentation slides are in the same location.

### 2. In order to run the code on pre-configured environments in Domino you must [log in](https://www.dominodatalab.com/try). After you log in you will need to navigate back to this project either with the URL or via the search option in the upper left.

### 3. Once logged in, fork this project using the button in the upper right of this screen. ![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/xAI/raw/3b5159c69231ddca732a95cf1cbd069574220efe/scratch/fork.png?inline=true)

### 4. In YOUR newly forked project you can spin up a workspace by navigating to Workspaces. Select an IDE. Give the workspace run a name if you like. Click Launch.
